# CC_DefaultClassifier

This notebook is an extension of a lab from the Master of Data Science curriculum at UBC Vancouver. For the project, I used credit card payment data on clients from Taiwan from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). I attempted simple feature engineering and used various supervised classifiers to predict whether or not a client would default on their next credit card payment. The best performing model overall was the support vector classifier (SVC) with a test accuracy of .828, f1 score of .447, recall of .327 and precision of .711. The best performing non-linear model was a random forest classifier (RFC) with a test accuracy of .813, f1 score of .471, recall of .372, and precision of .640.
